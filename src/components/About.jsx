        I firmly believe in work life balance. AI is my work and physics is my
        balance. I'm currently entangled between AI and Physics, much like
        Schrödinger's Cat is caught between being alive and dead.

        I haven’t slept in 4 years but i love what I do so sleeping can wait.
        We’re here to build!

        I also run a YouTube channel where I review tech products and explain
        concepts like machine learning and quantum physics. If you're into tech
        and love a good laugh, check it out!
